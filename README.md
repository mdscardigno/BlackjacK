#### PEDAC
PEDAC has two primary objectives:
process the problem (PEDA) and code with intent (C).

**** Understand the problem ****
A game of Blackjack starts with a new shuffled deck of cards and then, by the dealer dealing two cards to the player and him/herself.
The cards for the player are dealt by the dealer without the cards being visible to the dealer.
The dealer reveals only one cards and asks the player if he/she would like a card?
If the player asks for a card, the dealer hands it over. The player then checks if the sum of the two cards plus the new card have a value over 17. If the cards have a value of 17, the player stays or asks for another card.
If the player asks for another card and it is over 21, player is busted. If the player gets a 10 and and Ace, player wins. The total card value is added up at the beginning when the player and the dealer get their first twp cards.
The sum of the value of the cards shall be the total of the points assigned to each card.
If dealer gets a 17, he/she stands. If the player is closer to 21 than the dealer, the player wins.
If the player busted, dealer wins.
Card points are as follow:
Ace, King, Queen, King = 10 points each.
Cards 2 through 10 = 1 point.
Identify expected input and output
Make the requirements explicit
Identify rules
Mental model of the problem (optional)

If the total value of the cards hand is 17, the player stays or asks for another card.
If the player asks for another card and it is over 21, player is busted.
If the player gets a 10 and and Ace, player wins.
The total card value is added up at the beginning when the player and the dealer get their first twp cards.
