#### PEDAC
PEDAC has two primary objectives:
process the problem (PEDA) and code with intent (C).

**** Understand the problem ****
A game of Blackjack starts with a new shuffled deck of cards.
The deck of cards contains cards with ranks and suits.
When a card is dealt, we remove a card from the deck and hand it to the player's and dealer's hand.
The the dealer deals two cards to the player and him/herself.
The cards for the player are dealt by the dealer without the cards being visible to the dealer.
The dealer reveals only one cards and asks the player if he/she would like a card? Hit or Stand.
Player does not reveal his/her hand until the dealer does.
If the player asks for a card, the dealer hands it over without the dealer looking at the card.
The player then checks if the sum of the two cards is 17.
If the cards have a value of 17, the player stays or asks for another card.
If the player asks for another card and it is over 21, player is busted.
If the player is closer to 21 than the dealer, the player wins.
If the player gets a 10 and and Ace, player wins, BLACKJACK!.
The total card value is added up at the beginning when the player and the dealer get their first two cards.
The sum of the value of the cards shall be the total of the points assigned to each card.
See little table Gavin made.
If dealer gets a 17, he/she stands.
If the player busted, dealer wins.
Card points are as follow:
Ace, King, Queen, King = 10 points each.
Cards 2 through 10 = 1 point.



Identify expected input and output
Make the requirements explicit
Identify rules
Mental model of the problem (optional)
**** Examples / Test Cases ****
If the total value of the cards hand is 17, the player stays or asks for another card.
If the player asks for another card and it is over 21, player is busted.
If the player gets a 10 and and Ace, player wins.
The total card value is added up at the beginning when the player and the dealer get their first twp cards.
The sum of the value of the cards shall be the total of the points assigned to each card.
If dealer gets a 17, he/she stands. If the player is closer to 21 than the dealer, the player wins.
If the player busted, dealer wins.
If player or dealer get a 1 or a 11, its blackjack.
Card points are as follow:
Ace, King, Queen, King = 10 points each.
Cards 2 through 10 = 1 point.

Validate understanding of the problem
**** Data Structure ****
How we represent data that we will work with when converting the input to output.
**** Algorithm ****
Steps for converting input to output
**** Code ****
Implementation of Algorithm

Be deliberate in your practice and see if you can:
P - Restate the problem in your own more detailed words
E - Write out at least 6 to 12 examples of different amounts and types of tips (in this case)
D - Write down what kind of data (or code technique) will be useful
A - ALGORITHM - Write a good algorithm that you can use to VALIDATE your examples - once your algorithm works on your examples
C - Copy/paste your ALGORITHM into your code - Can you convert each line of your ALGORITHM into a line (or two) of CODE? If not, either break it down more, or come check with me if you are just missing some syntax knowledge
